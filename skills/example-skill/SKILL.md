# Example Skill

Use this as a starter template when adding a new skill under `skills/<name>/SKILL.md`.

## Overview

Briefly describe what the skill helps with and the core principle behind it.

## When to use

- Describe trigger conditions ("Use when ...")
- List concrete symptoms or scenarios
- List when NOT to use if it is commonly confused with something else

## Steps

1. Gather required context
2. Apply the workflow
3. Produce the expected output

## Examples

Add one or two short examples:

- A command example
- An input/output example
- A common edge case

## Notes

- Keep frontmatter minimal (`name`, `description`)
- Prefer searchable wording in `description`
- Keep instructions concise and reusable (not project-specific history)
